# FPGA Space Invaders

This is a system verilog project that implements a space invaders clone. This was done on the DE2-115 FPGA development board, 
using an SoC to communicate with an external USB keyboard and the on-board FPGA to implement the game logic and video driver.
The screen was connected to the board via the given VGA port.

The game is surprisingly fun to play and decently challenging. It consists of an array of enemies and a player spaceship
who fire missiles at each other until the player runs out of his or her 3 lives or all the enemy ships are destroyed.
